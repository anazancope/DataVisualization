# Gas Prices DataVisualization
This project is focused on data visualization using javascript. During 2019, I noticed that gas prices have been varying as the year comes by, thus I decided to create a data visualization displaying how price changes over the years and how it it varies according to each state. Thus we are using graphs, maps and chats for this project
